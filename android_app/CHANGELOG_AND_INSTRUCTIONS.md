Changes made:
- Added logging utility (util/LogUtil.kt) and replaced many empty catch blocks to log exceptions for easier diagnosis.
- Added TokenProvider (data/remote/auth/TokenProvider.kt) â€” simple in-memory token cache to avoid runBlocking in AuthInterceptor.
- Rewrote AuthInterceptor to prefer TokenProvider and log when no in-memory token is present.
- Added AuthAuthenticator (data/remote/auth/AuthAuthenticator.kt) which clears token cache and attempts to clear persistent token on receiving 401 responses.
- Implemented exponential backoff retry for pending-flush in TaskRepositoryImpl.tryFlushPending(). Now retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff and logs failures.
- Replaced silent exceptions in WebSocketManager with logging.

Important notes / manual steps still required:
- Some source files in the repository contain '...' placeholders or were truncated. I updated only the concrete code parts I could safely change. Because several files are incomplete, the project may still not compile without you restoring the truncated parts (look for lines containing '...').
- NetworkModule and Hilt wiring: I added AuthAuthenticator and TokenProvider classes but did not modify the (truncated) NetworkModule to include the Authenticator in OkHttpClient. Please add the authenticator when building your OkHttpClient provider:
  OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .authenticator(AuthAuthenticator(authPrefs))
    .addInterceptor(AuthInterceptor(authPrefs))
    .build()
- You should update your AuthRepositoryImpl login/logout code to call TokenProvider.setToken(token) after successful login and TokenProvider.clear() on logout. I could not reliably update the truncated login method bodies; search for 'saveToken' calls and add TokenProvider.setToken(resp.token) nearby.
- Consider adding user-facing conflict resolution UI. I did not implement UI changes in this pass.
- Removal or wiring of unused classes: I did NOT remove files. I recommend running a static analysis (e.g., IntelliJ's "Unused Declaration" inspection) to safely remove unused code. Manual review is required because some classes may be referenced reflectively or via Dagger.

How to apply & test:
1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Inspect files with '...' placeholders and restore missing code.
3. Wire the authenticator into your OkHttp client provider in NetworkModule.
4. Ensure AuthRepositoryImpl calls TokenProvider.setToken/clear appropriately.
5. Run the app and watch logcat for TAG 'MyTaskManager' log messages (I used util/LogUtil).

If you want, I can now try to:
- Patch the NetworkModule and AuthRepositoryImpl where possible (but the files contain '...' so my modifications may be unsafe).
- Perform a pass to mark files containing '...' so you can quickly find them.
